## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Create Labels
```bash
cd /home/runner/work/PROJECT-SWARM/PROJECT-SWARM
chmod +x scripts/create-labels.sh
./scripts/create-labels.sh
```

This creates all 40+ labels for the project.

### Step 2: Create Project Board
1. Go to: https://github.com/orgs/Universal-Standard/projects
2. Click "New project"
3. Select "Board" view
4. Name: "PROJECT-SWARM Development Board"
5. Click "Create"

### Step 3: Configure Project Board

**Option A: Automated Setup with GitHub CLI (Recommended)**

Follow the automated setup in `.github/PROJECT_BOARD_CONFIG.md`:
```bash
# See PROJECT_BOARD_CONFIG.md for complete CLI commands including:
# - Automated project board creation
# - Custom field creation (Priority, Effort, Component, Group, Sprint)
# - Bulk issue operations
# - Automation rules setup
# - View configuration via GraphQL API
```

**Option B: Manual Setup via Web Interface**

Follow the manual configuration steps in `.github/PROJECT_BOARD_CONFIG.md`:
- Create columns (New, Backlog, To Do, In Progress, etc.)
- Add custom fields (Priority, Effort, Component, Group)
- Configure automation rules
- Create multiple views (Board, Priority Matrix, Team View, etc.)

### Step 4: Set Repository Variable
```bash
# Using GitHub CLI
gh variable set PROJECT_BOARD_URL --body "https://github.com/orgs/Universal-Standard/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_NUMBER"

# Or via GitHub web interface:
# Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables → New repository variable
# Name: PROJECT_BOARD_URL
# Value: https://github.com/orgs/Universal-Standard/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_NUMBER
```

### Step 5: Enable Wiki
1. Go to repository Settings
2. Scroll to "Features"
3. Check "Wikis"
4. Click "Save"

### Step 6: Create Wiki Pages
Follow the guide in `docs/WIKI_SETUP.md` to create wiki pages:
- Home page with navigation
- Getting Started guide
- Project Board Guide
- API Reference
- Developer Guide

### Step 7: Test the System
1. Create a test issue using one of the templates
2. Verify it gets auto-labeled and added to project board
3. Test self-assignment option
4. Check that workflows trigger correctly

## Detailed Setup

### Issue Templates Setup

All issue templates are already created in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`:
- `01-bug-report.yml` - For critical bugs
- `02-feature-request.yml` - For new features
- `03-task.yml` - For development tasks
- `04-planned-upgrade.yml` - For major upgrades
- `05-fix.yml` - For non-critical fixes
- `config.yml` - Template configuration

**No action needed** - templates are ready to use!

### Workflows Setup

Four workflows are configured in `.github/workflows/`:

#### 1. Advanced Issue Triage (`advanced-issue-triage.yml`)
**Triggers**: When issues are opened, edited, or labeled
**Actions**:
- Auto-labels based on content
- Detects priority from severity
- Assigns component labels
- Maps to group labels
- Handles assignment types (self, auto, team, volunteer)
- Adds to project board
- Posts welcome comment

**No configuration needed** - works automatically!

#### 2. Orchestrator Assignment (`orchestrator-assignment.yml`)
**Triggers**: 
- Hourly cron schedule
- Manual workflow dispatch
**Actions**:
- Finds unassigned tasks with `auto-assign` label
- Assigns based on expertise and workload
- Updates labels to `orchestrator-assigned`
- Posts assignment comment

**Configuration needed**:
Edit the workflow to add team member usernames:
```yaml
const team = {
  'core-engine': {
    labels: ['group-a-core', 'execution-engine'],
    members: ['username1', 'username2'] // Add actual usernames
  },
  // ... more teams
};
```

#### 3. PR Automation (`pr-automation.yml`)
**Triggers**: PR events (opened, edited, reviewed, merged)
**Actions**:
- Labels PRs based on content
- Warns on large PRs
- Links issues to PRs
- Updates issue status throughout PR lifecycle
- Marks issues as deployed on merge

**No configuration needed** - works automatically!

#### 4. Parallel Agent Workflow (`parallel-agent-workflow.yml`)
**Triggers**: 
- Issue labeled with group labels
- Manual workflow dispatch
**Actions**:
- Runs parallel jobs based on group
- Executes group-specific tasks
- Reports progress

**Configuration**: Add test commands if needed

### Labels Configuration

All labels are defined in `scripts/create-labels.sh`:
- Priority labels (4): critical, high, medium, low
- Type labels (5): bug, enhancement, documentation, testing, fix
- Status labels (4): in-progress, blocked, needs-review, ready-for-testing
- Component labels (30+): workflow-builder, execution-engine, etc.
- Group labels (7): group-a-core through group-g-future
- Assignment labels (4): self-assigned, auto-assign, orchestrator-assigned, help-wanted

Run the script to create all labels:
```bash
./scripts/create-labels.sh
```

### Project Board Configuration

See `.github/PROJECT_BOARD_CONFIG.md` for complete configuration including:
- 12 columns (New, Backlog, To Do, In Progress, In Review, Ready to Merge, Deployed, Done, Feature Requests, Blocked, Critical Bugs, Analytics View)
- 6 custom fields (Priority, Effort, Component, Group, Sprint, Assignee Type)
- 10 views (Board, Priority Matrix, Team, Sprint, Group, Component, Timeline, Table, Feature Voting, Metrics)
- 12 automation rules
- Integration with GitHub Actions

### Wiki Setup

See `docs/WIKI_SETUP.md` for:
- Complete wiki structure
- Page templates
- Content guidelines
- Maintenance schedule

Create these key pages:
1. **Home** - Navigation and overview
2. **Getting Started** - Installation and quick start
3. **User Guide** - How to use features
4. **Developer Guide** - How to contribute
5. **Project Board Guide** - How to use the board
6. **API Reference** - API documentation
7. **Roadmap** - Future plans

### GitHub Copilot Setup

The file `.github/copilot-instructions.md` contains:
- Project-specific coding guidelines
- TypeScript and React patterns
- API and database conventions
- Security best practices
- Testing guidelines
- Git workflow conventions

**No configuration needed** - Copilot will automatically use these instructions when suggesting code!
