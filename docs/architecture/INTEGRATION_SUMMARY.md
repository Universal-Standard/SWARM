## Why Integrate?

### Complementary Strengths

| Capability | SWARM | Ragbits | Combined |
|------------|-------|---------|----------|
| Visual Workflow Design | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ SWARM UI |
| RAG Capabilities | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ Add to SWARM |
| LLM Providers | 3 | 100+ | ✅ Massive expansion |
| Document Processing | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ New capability |
| Multi-Agent Orchestration | Basic | Advanced | ✅ Best of both |
| Real-time Monitoring | ✅ | Basic | ✅ SWARM excels |
| Cost Tracking | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ Keep SWARM's |

### New Capabilities Unlocked

1. **Document-to-Workflow Pipeline**
   - Upload documents → Parse → Index → Query → Respond
   - All via visual workflow

2. **Advanced Research Agents**
   - Multi-agent coordination with RAG retrieval
   - Web search + knowledge base + synthesis

3. **Enterprise RAG Applications**
   - Production-ready RAG with monitoring
   - Cost tracking across 100+ LLM providers
   - Visual workflow management

## How to Integrate?

### Recommended Architecture: Service-Oriented

```
┌──────────────────────────┐
│  SWARM Frontend (React)   │  ← User Interface
└────────────┬─────────────┘
             │ REST/WebSocket
┌────────────▼─────────────┐
│  SWARM Backend (Express)  │  ← Orchestration
└────────────┬─────────────┘
             │ gRPC/REST
┌────────────▼─────────────┐
│  Ragbits Service (Python) │  ← RAG Operations
└────────────┬─────────────┘
             │
┌────────────▼─────────────┐
│  PostgreSQL + Vector DB   │  ← Storage
└──────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Points:**
- SWARM remains primary UI and orchestration layer
- Ragbits runs as separate Python service
- Communication via REST/gRPC
- Shared database for state

- Can't support rapid iteration pace

### What's next?
1. **Approve integration** (Day 0)
2. **Create 52 GitHub Issues** (Day 0, 1 hour)
3. **Set up 4 AI agent instances** (Day 0)
4. **Start Day 1** (12-16 features in parallel)
5. **Production launch** (Day 4)
